FLOKI

Floki is a script developed in Python that allows you to automate volatility processes by automatically displaying txt files with most of the functions that volatility itself has.

The ability to extract information of interest from the ram memory file with Bulk_extractor has also been added.

The extraction of hashes from the processes has been automated and they are sent to the following Sandboxes of Virustotal, Crowdstrike and MalwareBazar.

Includes MalConfScan plugin from Japan Cert

The general characteristics are:

•	Automatic detection of the ram file profile

•	Creation of an MFT timeline and memory data

•	Process automation and extraction
